# ◈ Delta Vault — Adaptive Delta-Neutral Vault Strategy

> **Hackathon Submission** · Drift Protocol · Solana · BTC + ETH

A production-ready delta-neutral vault strategy that generates stable yield through funding rate arbitrage, basis spread capture, cross-chain opportunity routing, and adaptive capital allocation — with zero directional price exposure.

---

## ⚠️ Simulation Mode

This project runs in **simulation mode** by default. No real funds are at risk. Configure `.env` to go live on Drift Protocol devnet or mainnet.

---

## Strategy Overview

| Mode | Trigger | Action | Yield Source |
|------|---------|--------|--------------|
| **DELTA_NEUTRAL** | \|Funding rate\| > 0.001%/hr | Long/short spot + opposite perp | Funding payments |
| **BASIS_TRADE** | Basis spread > 0.5% | Buy spot + short futures | Spread convergence |
| **PARK_CAPITAL** | No opportunity | Deploy leftover to stable yield | Lending APY |
| **CROSS_CHAIN** | Better net edge on another chain | Bridge capital to best venue | Inter-venue funding arb |

**Bidirectional funding:** Positive funding → LONG spot + SHORT perp. Negative funding → SHORT spot + LONG perp.  
**Historical Opportunity Range:** 8–25% APY (market-dependent)  
**Max Drawdown:** 10% hard stop  
**Net Delta:** ~0 (market-neutral)

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** Historical funding rates and basis spreads do not guarantee future returns. Yield is entirely dependent on prevailing market conditions, funding rate regimes, and liquidity. The 8–25% range reflects observed historical opportunity windows — actual results may be significantly lower or zero in low-volatility or negative-funding environments.

## New Features

### 🏦 Capital Manager
Every cycle starts with a strict reserve-before-execute flow:

1. **Reserve** — allocate capital for each trade before execution
2. **Execute** — use only reserved amount (never hardcoded sizes)
3. **Release** — return reserved capital if execution fails or is skipped
4. **Lend** — deploy only remaining leftover capital to stable yield

A dedicated `[CAPITAL]` section is printed each cycle:
```
[CAPITAL]
Starting: $250000.00
Reserved For Trades: $1953.00
Released From Failed/Skipped: $0.00
Remaining Before Lending: $248047.00
Lent (Leftover): $248047.00
Remaining After Lending: $0.00
CarryOver BTC: $0.00 | ETH: $412.00 | Total: $412.00
```

### 📈 Carryover Accumulation
Sub-minimum allocations are no longer discarded. Instead they accumulate across cycles and execute once meaningful:

- Allocation below `MIN_TRADE_SIZE` ($1,000) → **accumulated** into per-asset carryover
- Carryover + next cycle's allocation → **executes** once the sum crosses the minimum
- Signal gone quiet → carryover **decays by 25% per cycle** (`CARRYOVER_DECAY = 0.75`) instead of hard resetting
- Carryover below $1 → **expires** cleanly with a log event

### 🌉 Cross-Chain Funding Arbitrage
The bot evaluates funding rates across 7 chains per cycle and routes capital to the highest net-yield venue after bridge + gas + slippage costs:

| Chain | Venue |
|-------|-------|
| Solana | Drift Protocol |
| Arbitrum | GMX |
| Base | — |
| Optimism | — |
| Polygon | — |
| Avalanche | — |
| BNB Chain | — |

Decisions are fee-adjusted over a configurable projection horizon. A cross-chain move only executes when `expectedProfitUSD > 0` after all costs.

### 📊 Live Dashboard Sync
The bot serves a real-time JSON state endpoint at `http://localhost:3001`. The dashboard polls it every 5 seconds and renders actual bot state instead of simulated values:

- Prices, funding rates, basis
- Open positions (per-leg: spot + perp)
- Execution events
- Lending by asset
- Capital manager state (reserved, lent, carryover)
- Cross-chain decisions and funding map

### 🤖 Adaptive AI Agent + Execution Guardrails
The bot now includes a lightweight adaptive AI agent module that observes funding conditions and gates per-cycle execution:

- Picks a preferred asset (or skips) based on live observation + rolling performance
- Applies dynamic max-size caps from confidence/win-rate/volatility
- Emits structured `[AI AGENT]` logs each cycle (observation, decision, state)
- Exposes agent state over the bot API for dashboard rendering (mode, confidence, reason)

To disable it quickly for testing, set `AI_AGENT_ENABLED=false` in `.env`.

### 🔁 Reverse Delta-Neutral (Negative Funding)
Delta-neutral execution is now explicitly two-way and regime-aware:

- Positive funding: **LONG spot + SHORT perp**
- Negative funding: **SHORT spot + LONG perp**
- Exit logic is direction-aware (uses effective funding, not raw sign)
- Strong funding regime flips trigger close/reverse behavior instead of stale hold states
- Close signals now actually clear legs and reset strategy state so re-entry can happen cleanly

### 🖥️ Dashboard Consistency Updates
Recent dashboard behavior updates reduce live/sim confusion:

- Vault PnL history now appends from live bot data during API sync
- Simulation mode supports reverse delta-neutral signals (negative funding path)
- Simulated positions are visibly tagged with `SIM` so they are distinguishable from live bot positions
- The AI agent panel is shown as a dedicated spotlight row with live decision + risk context

### 🛡️ Improved Risk Engine
| Improvement | Detail |
|-------------|--------|
| Funding clamped | ±0.5% max (`sanitizeFunding`) |
| Smoothed funding | EMA with α=0.2, initialized to first sample (no startup spike) |
| Relative volatility | `abs(current - prev) / max(abs(prev), 0.0001)` instead of raw std-dev/mean |
| Lower threshold | 0.5 → **0.2** for earlier detection |
| Debounced warning | `REDUCE_SIZE` fires once on entry, clears once normalized (no 10s spam) |
| Warm-up guard | Volatility check suppressed until ≥4 smoothed samples collected |

## Quick Start

### 1. Dashboard

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

The dashboard polls the bot state API automatically. Falls back to simulation mode if the bot is not running.

### 2. Bot

```bash
cd bot
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Helius API key and wallet keypair
npm run dev
```

### 3. Enable Secret-Scan Hook (Recommended)

This repo includes a pre-commit hook at `.githooks/pre-commit` that blocks common secret leaks (`.env`, `keypair.json`, private keys, tokens).

Run once after clone:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

Validate manually:

```bash
.githooks/pre-commit
```

Emergency bypass (not recommended):

```bash
SKIP_SECRET_SCAN=1 git commit -m "..."
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A funded Solana wallet (keypair JSON file or base58 private key)
- [Helius API key](https://helius.dev) (free tier works)
- USDC deposited as collateral on [Drift Protocol](https://drift.trade)

## Security

- **Never commit** your `keypair.json` or `.env` file
- Use a **dedicated hot wallet** with only the capital you intend to deploy
- Add `keypair.json` and `.env` to `.gitignore` (already included)
- Consider a [Squads multisig](https://squads.so) for larger vault sizes

## Disclaimer

This project is a **hackathon submission and proof of concept**. It runs in simulation mode by default. Nothing in this repository constitutes financial advice.

**Past funding rates and basis spreads do not guarantee future returns.** The historical opportunity range of 8–25% APY reflects periods of elevated market activity. In low-volatility or bear-market conditions, funding rates can turn negative, eliminating or reversing yield. Use at your own risk.
